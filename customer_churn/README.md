# Customer Churn Prediction (Synthetic)
Goal: Predict customer churn using historical usage, support call logs, and activity metrics.

Contents:
- `customer_data.csv` - synthetic customer dataset.
- `customer_churn_notebook.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook demonstrating preprocessing, SMOTE imbalance handling, Logistic Regression and XGBoost models.
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies.

How to run:
1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open the notebook: `jupyter notebook customer_churn_notebook.ipynb`
3. Train models and export artifacts as needed.

Notes:
- Dataset is synthetic for demo/portfolio use. Replace with actual customer data for real projects and ensure proper privacy handling.
